                    OOTD brings the latest international trends to the street in the form of
                    easy, comfortable and casual clothes. The OOTD collections are conceived
                    with the idea of dressing men and women with a young mindset, taking into
                    account that age is not an obstacle when choosing our wardrobe.

                <p className="section-paragraph">
                    OOTD has two completely different lines for both guys and girls. On one
                    hand, teenagers will find the more casual lines in stores in the form of
                    sweatshirts, t-shirts, jeans, Bermuda shorts, plimsolls and hats, where
                    cotton is the main fabric.
                </p>
                <p className="section-paragraph">
                    The second line is directed at more adult male and female consumers who
                    have grown up with the brand. For them OOTD creates garments that are
                    inspired by the latest international trends for both daytime and evening
                    wear, and that can be worn at work and during leisure time. This line
                    adapts these trends to the needs of OOTD customers, making them more
                    relaxed and turning them into easy-to-wear garments.

                    The textile collection is backed up by the footwear, accessory, jewellery,
                    fragrance, headphones, longskates and sunglasses lines.
