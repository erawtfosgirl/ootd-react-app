                    OOTD started up in 1991 with a clear international mission and with the
                    intention of dressing young people who are engaged with their environment,
                    who live in the community and relate to each other. Young people who have
                    a casual dress sense, who shun stereotypes and who want to feel good in
                    whatever they are wearing. To meet their needs, OOTD takes the latest
                    international trends, mixing them with the influences that are seen on the
                    street and in the most fashionable clubs, and reworks them according to
                    their style thus turning them into comfortable and easy to wear garments.

                    OOTD evolves at the same pace as its customer, always watching out for new
                    technologies, social movements and the latest artistic or musical trends.
                    All of this can be seen reflected not only in its designs but also in
                    stores. Inspired by the legendary Californian city of Palm Springs, the
                    product lines are constantly being updated. All stores worldwide receive
                    new merchandise twice a week.
